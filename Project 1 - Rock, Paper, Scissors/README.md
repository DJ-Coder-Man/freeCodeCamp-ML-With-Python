# Project 1 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Overview
> For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning **at least 60%** of the games in each match.
>
> You will be [working on this project with our Ona starter code](https://app.ona.com/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors/).
>
> We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the machine learning curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.

## Recommended Setup
While Ona (previously Gitpod) provides a cloud and browser-based VSCode environment, it is not ideal for completing this project due to:

- Progress not being saved unless you connect your GitHub to Ona
- The initial setup of forking the repo and downloading all necessary components adds unnecessary steps and complexity
- A local environment is simpler and more reliable

I'd recommend following these steps for a local and better experience:

1. Clone the official freeCodeCamp repository for this project:
[https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors)
2. Create a private GitHub repo by importing the same repository link above to save your progress
3. Open up the cloned repo in your preferred IDE or text editor
4. **(OPTIONAL)** Use GitHub Desktop to manage your commits and pushes
